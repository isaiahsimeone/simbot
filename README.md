# simbot
A discord bot


Todo:

- add level_slider emoji to all successfully playing single songs (i.e. not in playlist)
- reacting with this level_slider emoji should remove that emoji and show an emoji for playing, fastforwarding, rewinding, pausing (and playing (toggle)).
- Clicking any of these emojis should action the song accordingly.
- Once a reaction is made to any of these emoji's, the users reaction should be removed signifying that they may react again (and therefore control the audio playback)
- FIX AGE RESTRICTED VIDEOS. Simbot says it will play, but it cannot (use DyE - Fantasy or aj tracy lovser)
- Add -w2g which generates a watchtogether room and sends the link to it
- -p #doyalike kazeWIW ???
- Soundcloud
